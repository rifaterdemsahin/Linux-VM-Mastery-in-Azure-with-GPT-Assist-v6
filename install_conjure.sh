To install `conjure-up` on an Ubuntu system using Snap, you will follow a relatively straightforward process. `conjure-up` is a software provisioning tool that simplifies the deployment of complex software stacks using Juju. Here's how you can install it using Snap, the package management system that comes with Ubuntu:

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Open your terminal**: You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` on your keyboard or by searching for "Terminal" in your application launcher.

2. **Update your package list** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install Snap** (if it’s not already installed on your system):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install snapd
   ```

4. **Install `conjure-up`**:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install conjure-up --classic
   ```

   The `--classic` flag is necessary because `conjure-up` requires access to system resources that are outside of the security confinement that Snap typically provides.

5. **Verify the installation**: Check if `conjure-up` is installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   conjure-up --version
   ```

   This command should return the version of `conjure-up` that you have installed.

### Additional Setup

- **LXD Setup**: If you plan to deploy applications locally using LXD (a system container and virtual machine manager), you might need to install and set up LXD:
  ```bash
  sudo snap install lxd
  sudo lxd init
  ```
  The `lxd init` command will guide you through the initial setup, which is important for creating containers on your machine.

- **Juju Setup**: Since `conjure-up` leverages Juju, ensure Juju is installed and configured:
  ```bash
  sudo snap install juju --classic
  juju bootstrap
  ```

  `juju bootstrap` initializes a Juju environment, which is necessary for deploying and managing applications through Juju.

### Usage

Once installed, you can start `conjure-up` by simply entering `conjure-up` in the terminal. It will guide you through deploying applications like Kubernetes, OpenStack, or even smaller test applications, depending on what's available in the spell list at that time.

That’s it! You now have `conjure-up` installed on your Ubuntu system using Snap, and you can begin deploying complex software stacks with it.
